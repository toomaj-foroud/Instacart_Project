# Instacart_Project
## Analysis of Instacart grocery retail company using Python

This is the 4th achievement of data analysis Course in CAREERFOUNDRY

Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more
information about their sales patterns. Our task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same  methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.
